While Developer DAO’s server going forward, will prioritize the 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 member experience, it’s still important that people have the opportunity to step into contributor roles, or complete various open tasks under 𝗗𝗗 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝘀

Developer DAO (🧱, 🚀): The 𝗗𝗗 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝘀 section is officially live in Discord ✅
It is comprised of forum-based channels — and over time, tasks and roles under DD Labs will be shared as forum posts. DAO members can then asks teams clarifying questions, and easily obtain context inside each post! ☺️ https://t.co/KTZ0yyv8uy]]></summary>

As cited in the thread below, there was a need to move all operational teams into a new Discord, and retrofit Developer DAO’s server to prioritize 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 members as a default. Doing so, has drastically helped to reduce the size of our server https://t.co/sHkvxuB6MJ

Many of you left feedback that Developer DAO’s server was disorganized and overwhelming 😰 And at one point, we even reached Discord’s limit of 500 channels 🤯
The default view has since been drastically cut down to only 6 categories ☺️ 🙏
